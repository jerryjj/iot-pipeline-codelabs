# IoT Data Pipelines in GCP - workshop

These are the supporting Codelabs for workshop I run about data pipelines in GCP.

- [Codelab part 1](https://jerryjj.github.io/iot-pipeline-codelabs/part1/index.html)
- [Codelab part 2](https://jerryjj.github.io/iot-pipeline-codelabs/part2/index.html)

## Development

### Generating the codelabs

```sh
claat export part1.md
claat export part2.md
```

### Serving

Open another terminal and run

```sh
claat serve
```

This will open your browser to <http://localhost:9090/>
To be able to navigate to different parts append eg `/part1` to the url.
